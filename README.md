# About

I'm new to Ruby right now and I'm doing some stuff on my own in order to learn something about it. During it, I needed to do this code.

So, to show some work and (why not?) inspire others, I'm making it public.

It's not intended (yet) to be merged with other gems or libraries, because it's **experimental code**.
